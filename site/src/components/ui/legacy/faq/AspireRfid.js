    <div label="What is factory default?">
      <p>
        When product ships from our warehouse, it is in factory default mode. This means it has not been assigned a Programming or Manager Key.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keypad Locks will operate by pressing <DigiSymbol ds={'buttonC'}/> then <DigiSymbol ds={'buttonKey'}/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        RFID Locks will operate by pressing <DigiSymbol ds={'buttonKey'}/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another indicator that a keypad lock is in factory default mode is if you can lock the lock with a 4-7 digit user code, and unlock with a different 4-7 digit user code.
      </p>
      <p>
        When locks operate at the factory setting, they are not secure. Follow the <span

    <div label="What is the Yellow Key?">
      <p>
        The Yellow Key is the Programming key. Its main function is to Initialize the lock system, assign Manager Keys,
        and enable product features. When introduced to a lock in factory default mode, the Programming key will become
        registered to the lock, allowing the lock to function as ordered
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow the <span
        onClick={() => jumpAccordion(props.product + ' RFID Getting Started',
          'Initial Setup')}>Initial Setup instructions</span> of your product guide to program your Programming Key.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programming Key must first be initialized to the lock system otherwise, the lock(s) will remain in factory default and will not respond to Programming or Manager Key(s).
      </p>
      <p>
        One Programming Key is allowed per locking system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Programming Key can also provide lock access. Refer to the Product Guide for instructions on how to use the programming key for lock access.

    <div label="What is the Black Key?">
      <p>
        The Black Key is your Manager Key. This key provides override access, external power, and used to register user codes and ADA user keys.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must program the Black Manager Keys to the locking system. Otherwise, the lock(s) will emit a single beep and LED flash when inserted into the key slot and the bolt will not move.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each lock will program up to (6) Black Manager Keys.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Yellow Programming Key is required to register Manager Key(s) to the locks. Refer to the Product Guide for instructions.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div label="What is the User Credential?">
      <p>
        The User credential is your Code, RFID Card or Blue ADA User Key. The Blue ADA User Key is an optional user credential and keeps the locking system ADA compliant.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your locks are Assigned use functionality, you must program the Blue ADA User Keys to the locking system. Otherwise, the lock(s) will emit a single beep and LED flash when inserted into the key slot and the bolt will not move.

    {/*</div>*/}
    <div label="How can I speed up the programming process?">
      <p>After you have followed the initial setup on one lock and tested the lock to ensure successful programming of all keys necessary, you will then follow the <span
